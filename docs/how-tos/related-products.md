# Related Products

One or more products can be related to a product, from the **Related Products** tab when editing a product.

An example might be that you are selling mobile phones, and you wish to relate a mobile phone __cover__ product with each mobile phone.

Products added to the list of related products can be re-ordered by drag-and-drop.


### Displaying Related Products

By default, product pages are not configured to display related products. Related products are displayed via a **Product List** block, configured to do so.

To display related products:
- Add Product List block to a Product page
- Configure the block's **List Products** setting to **Related to a product displayed on this page**
- Configure the **Sort Order** to **Related Products Order** if you wish the order to reflect what is selected on the **Related Products** tab of a product
- Configure other options on the block as required

::: tip Adding a default block
Instead of manually adding a new Product List block to every product page on your site, you can add a default Product List block to the Product page, using the settings above.
Alternatively if you are creating your own theme, you could create a Global area for this block on your Product page template.
