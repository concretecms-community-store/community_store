# Multilingual

When your concrete5 site is configured with [multiple languages](/how-tos/multilingual), product details, options and other pieces of text displayed in your store can be translated in full.
Translations are managed through the **Store / Multilingual** dashboard page.

The translations process is designed that repeatly used 'common' pieces of text to describe products and product options only needs to be translated once, instead of on each product.
Community Store will refer to the 'common' translations first when displaying a translated product, but the pieces of text can still be individual translated on a per-product basis if necessary.

Therefore, it is suggested to visit the  **Store / Multilingual / Common** dashboard page first and complete the translations there, before working through individual product translations.
